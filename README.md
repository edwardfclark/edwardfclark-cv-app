# React CV

This is a project I put together as part of a job application's technical test. The requirements were to create a small application dynamically-built using a JSON file. The time limit was 4-5 hours. I ended up making a version of my CV using React, although I had to leave out some parts due to running up against the time limit. I felt it was more important to showcase my ability to build reusable components than to have a fully-accurate CV to present.

## Libraries Used

- React.
- styled-components.
- lodash.
- Font Awesome.

## TO DO

- Implement data tracking to show the length of time a user spends on a page or viewing an asset.
- Implement a picture of myself somewhere on the CV.
- More attractive styling, backgrounds, and imagery.
- Hobbies and Interests.
- More responsive design. Although the site itself does scale fine at tablet levels, it could function better on mobile and other very small screen sizes. I meant to do this, I just ran out of time.
